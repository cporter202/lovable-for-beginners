## 💡 Key Concepts for Beginners

### 🎨 What is "Vibe Coding"?

> **Vibe Coding** is Lovable's approach to building apps. Instead of writing code line by line, you describe what you want in natural language, and AI builds it for you. It's like having a conversation with a developer who understands exactly what you mean.

### 💰 Understanding Credits

**Chat Mode:**
- Cost: 1 credit per message
- Best for: Planning, debugging, questions

**Agent Mode:**
- Cost: Usage-based (often less than 1 credit)
- Best for: Complex tasks, building features

**Code Mode:**
- Cost: Included in paid plans
- Best for: Advanced customization

**💡 Tip:** Many simple tasks cost very little, while complex tasks may cost more.

### 🎯 Modes Explained Simply

- **Agent Mode** → "Build this for me" → AI does the work autonomously
- **Chat Mode** → "Help me understand" → AI helps you plan and debug
- **Code Mode** → "Show me the code" → View/edit code directly (paid plans)

### 🎨 Templates vs. Starting from Scratch

- **🎨 Templates:** Pre-built apps you can customize (great for beginners!)
- **🚀 From Scratch:** Describe your idea and build it fresh

Both approaches are valid - choose what feels right!
