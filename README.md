## 💡 Key Concepts for Beginners

### What is "Vibe Coding"?
Vibe Coding is Lovable's approach to building apps. Instead of writing code line by line, you describe what you want in natural language, and AI builds it for you. It's like having a conversation with a developer who understands exactly what you mean.

### Understanding Credits
- Lovable uses a credit system
- **Chat Mode:** 1 credit per message
- **Agent Mode:** Usage-based (varies by complexity, often less than 1 credit)
- Many simple tasks cost very little
- Complex tasks may cost more

### Modes Explained Simply
- **Agent Mode:** "Build this for me" - AI does the work autonomously
- **Chat Mode:** "Help me understand" - AI helps you plan and debug
- **Code Mode:** "Show me the code" - View/edit code directly (paid plans)

### Templates vs. Starting from Scratch
- **Templates:** Pre-built apps you can customize (great for beginners!)
- **Starting from scratch:** Describe your idea and build it fresh
- Both approaches are valid - choose what feels right
