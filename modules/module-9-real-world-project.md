### Your Task

**Think about your app:**

## 🛠️ Step 2: Setting Up the Project

### Create Your Project

#### Step 1: Start a New Project

1. **Go to Lovable dashboard**
2. **Click in the search box**
3. **Type your initial prompt:**

```
Create a task manager application called "[Your App Name]". Start with a modern, clean design using [your color choice] as the primary color. Include a landing page that explains what the app does.
```

**Example:**
```
Create a task manager application called "TaskMaster". Start with a modern, clean design using blue (#0066CC) as the primary color. Include a landing page that explains what the app does.
```

#### Step 2: Review What Was Built

1. **Look at your landing page**
2. **Check the design**
3. **See if you like the colors and style**
4. **Make adjustments if needed:**

```
Change the primary color to [your preferred color]
Make the design more [modern/minimal/colorful]
Update the app name to [your choice]
```

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Get the design right first! It's easier to build on a good foundation.

## 🛠️ Step 3: Setting Up the Backend

### Enable Authentication and Database

#### Step 1: Enable Backend

Ask Lovable:
```
Enable Lovable Cloud for this project to add user authentication and database storage
```

Or if you prefer Supabase:
```
Connect Supabase to this project for authentication and database
```

#### Step 2: Set Up the Database

Ask Lovable:
```
Create a database table for tasks with the following fields:
- id (unique identifier)
- title (text - the task name)
- description (text - task details)
- category (text - like Work, Personal, Shopping)
- priority (text - High, Medium, Low)
- dueDate (date - when it's due)
- completed (boolean - is it done?)
- userId (text - who owns this task)
- createdAt (date - when created)
- updatedAt (date - last updated)
```

#### Step 3: Verify Setup

Ask Lovable:
```
Show me that the database is set up correctly
```

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Don't worry if this seems technical! Lovable handles the complex parts. You're just describing what data you need to store.

---

## 🛠️ Step 4: Building the Authentication Pages

### Create Sign Up Page

Ask Lovable:
```
Create a sign up page with:
- Email and password fields
- Password confirmation field
- "Sign Up" button
- Link to login page ("Already have an account? Login")
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Success message after sign up
Make it match the design of the landing page
```

### Create Login Page

Ask Lovable:
```
Create a login page with:
- Email and password fields
- "Login" button
- Link to sign up page ("Don't have an account? Sign up")
- "Forgot password?" link
- Error handling for wrong credentials
Make it match the sign up page design
```

### Add Navigation

Ask Lovable:
```
Add a navigation menu that shows:
- App logo/name (links to home)
- "My Tasks" link (only visible when logged in)
- "Login" button (when not logged in)
- "Sign Up" button (when not logged in)
- User name and "Logout" button (when logged in)
Make it sticky (stays at top when scrolling)
```

### Test Authentication

1. **Try signing up:**
   - Go to sign up page
   - Enter email and password
   - Submit
   - You should be logged in!

2. **Try logging out:**
   - Click logout
   - You should be logged out

3. **Try logging in:**
   - Go to login page
   - Enter your credentials
   - You should be logged in!

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Test as you build! Make sure each piece works before moving on.

## 🛠️ Step 5: Building the Task Management Features

### Create the Tasks Dashboard

Ask Lovable:
```
Create a "My Tasks" page (dashboard) that:
- Only accessible to logged-in users
- Shows a welcome message with user's name
- Displays statistics: Total tasks, Completed tasks, Pending tasks
- Has a "Create New Task" button prominently
- Shows a list of all user's tasks
- Each task shows: title, category, priority, due date, and completion status
- Tasks can be clicked to view/edit
Make it visually appealing with cards or a clean list
```

### Create Task Form

Ask Lovable:
```
Create a "Create Task" page with a form that has:
- Task title (required)
- Description (optional, text area)
- Category dropdown (Work, Personal, Shopping, Health, Other)
- Priority dropdown (High, Medium, Low)
- Due date picker
- "Create Task" button
- "Cancel" button (goes back to dashboard)
- Form validation (title is required)
Make it user-friendly with clear labels
```

### Add Task Actions

Ask Lovable:
```
On the tasks list, add action buttons for each task:
- "Edit" button (opens edit form)
- "Delete" button (with confirmation)
- "Mark Complete/Incomplete" toggle
- Show tasks with completed ones visually different (grayed out or checked)
```

### Create Edit Task Page

Ask Lovable:
```
Create an "Edit Task" page that:
- Pre-fills the form with existing task data
- Allows editing all fields
- Has "Save Changes" button
- Has "Cancel" button
- Has "Delete Task" button
- Updates the task in the database
```

### Add Filtering and Sorting

Ask Lovable:
```
Add filtering and sorting to the tasks dashboard:
- Filter by category (All, Work, Personal, etc.)
- Filter by priority (All, High, Medium, Low)
- Filter by status (All, Completed, Pending)
- Sort by: Due date, Priority, Created date
- Show active filter/sort selections
Make the filters easy to use with dropdowns or buttons
```

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Build features one at a time. Test each one before adding the next!

## 🛠️ Step 6: Improving the Design

### Make It Beautiful

Ask Lovable:
```
Improve the design of the task manager:
- Use consistent spacing throughout
- Add hover effects on buttons and cards
- Make completed tasks visually distinct (strikethrough, different color)
- Add icons for categories and priorities
- Improve the color scheme for better contrast
- Make it feel modern and polished
- Ensure good readability
```

### Make It Responsive

Ask Lovable:
```
Make the task manager fully responsive:
- Works well on mobile phones
- Works well on tablets
- Works well on desktop
- Navigation adapts to screen size
- Forms are easy to use on mobile
- Touch-friendly buttons and interactions
```

### Add Polish

Ask Lovable:
```
Add finishing touches:
- Loading states (show spinner when loading data)
- Success messages (when task is created/updated)
- Empty states (nice message when no tasks)
- Smooth animations for transitions
- Better error messages
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
```

**💡 Beginner Tip:** Good design makes a huge difference! Take time to make it look professional.
